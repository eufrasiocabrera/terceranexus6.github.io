This is a friendly way to introduce myself. Let's begin with a how-to
compile this, but's it's quite easy.

You can both execute the .sh in linux or compile the c++ project using

g++ -o PAULADELAHOZ discoverPaula.cpp

It's a basic c++ program, so there should be no problem here. If there's a
"command not found" ERROR, try typing

a+x install.sh

FAQ:

- Why a floppy?
Apart from the fact that I have tons of them, it's because I thought it
would be funny.

- Why not a graphical app?
Text adventures are so cool, they were the first kind of videogames ever
and I really wanted to make my own.

- Do you like tea?
Yes I do.
